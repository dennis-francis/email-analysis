# email-analysis
This is a small Data Science project containing EDA and Modeling notebooks.
The objective of this project was to download all of my emails using the Gmail API, and using Data Science tools, to try and make some sense out of it. Basic bar charts and word clouds are done, and in the end, two models are fit: Naive Bayes classifier and DistilBERT NLP LLM.

Features of this project:
- 650 Datapoints, obtained from by Gmail inbox using the Gmail API
- EDA notebook for exploratory work and wrangling, and the NB model
- Modeling Notebook with the NLP model using the Hugging Faces library. Nb was run on Colab
